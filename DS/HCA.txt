Dataset
mtcars(motor trend car road test) comprises fuel consumption, performance and 10 aspects of automobile design for 32 automobiles. 
It comes pre installed with dplyr package in R.

# Installing the package
install.packages("dplyr")
	
# Loading package
library(dplyr)
	
# Summary of dataset in package
head(mtcars)

Performing Hierarchical clustering on Dataset
Using Hierarchical Clustering algorithm on the dataset using hclust() which is pre installed in stats package when R is intalled.

# Finding distance matrix
distance_mat <- dist(mtcars, method = 'euclidean')
distance_mat

# Fitting Hierarchical clustering Model to training dataset
set.seed(240) # Setting seed
Hierar_cl <- hclust(distance_mat, method = "average")
Hierar_cl

# Plotting dendrogram
plot(Hierar_cl)

# Choosing no. of clusters
# Cutting tree by height
abline(h = 110, col = "green")

# Cutting tree by no. of clusters
fit <- cutree(Hierar_cl, k = 3 )
fit

table(fit)
rect.hclust(Hierar_cl, k = 3, border = "green")

So, Tree is cut where k = 3 and each category represents its number of clusters.
